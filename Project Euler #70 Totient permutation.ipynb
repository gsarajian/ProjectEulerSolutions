    "Note that $\\phi(n) = n \\prod_{p|n} (1-1/p)$, so for the ratio of $n/\\phi(n)$ to be minimized, we want the product over the primes to be as big as possible. Each factor in the the product of primes is less than one, so the fewer primes involved the better. No prime will be a permutation of $\\phi(p)$ since $\\phi(p) = p-1$, so we check products of two primes. It likely isn't too hard to compute the exact reason why a product of three primes won't suffice, but we'll skip that for now."
