    "We treat this as a graph theory problem, where the vertices are the figurate numbers (triangle, square, etc.) of four digits, and a (directed) edge connects two vertices if the last two digits of the first vertex match the first two of the second. We also keep track of the \"index\" of each vertex, which simply tells us which type of figurate number we're working with. Once this is all set up, we do a breadth first search to connect edges and look at paths of length five whose two consecutive indices don't match. Once we have this, we refine this to make sure none of the indices match, then we sum the values of the figurate numbers."
