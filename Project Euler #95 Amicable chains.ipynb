    "We're searching for the longest cycle in a directed graph. We propose two solutions - one which does the work from square one, and the other which uses built in algorithms in networkx to find cycles. Both solutions use a helper function, divisorGenerator, that we've defined in previous solutions, which takes in an integer input $n$ and returns all of the divisors of $n$.\n",

    "From scratch solution: We iterate through all $i \\in [1, 10^6]$ and perform a depth first search on the next vertex. For some $i$, we create a list of succeeding vertices until the sum of the proper divisors is a value that we've seen before (for any $i$), or above $10^6$. If it's a value that we've seen before, we check if it's in the current list, in which case we've generated a new cycle that we haven't seen before. We find the length of that cycle and if it's the longest that we've seen so far, we save the cycle. If it's a value that we've seen in another list, then it will lead to a cycle that we've seen before. Finally, we take the minimum value of this longest cycle.\n",
