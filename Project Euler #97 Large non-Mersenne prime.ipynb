    "We use successive squaring and Euler's theorem to compute the value. We start by taking the exponent $a=7830457$ and writing it in binary $a = a_m a_{m-1} \\cdots a_1$. We keep a running product called \"out\" which will end up being $2^a$. We initialize \"out\" as 1 and then compute powers $2^{2^b}$ and multiplying these powers by \"out\" if the corresponding bit $a^b$ in the binary represntation of $a$ is $1$. This computes $2^a$ as $2^{a_m \\cdot 2^m + a_{m-1} \\cdot 2^{m-1} \\cdots + a_1 \\cdot 2}$. Finishing the computation is relatively straightforward."
