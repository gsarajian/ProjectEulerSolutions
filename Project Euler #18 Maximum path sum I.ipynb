    "Like the note says, we could brute force this, but to be more efficient, we'll use dynamic programming. Specifically, we'll use the [Viterbi algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm). After setting the problem up in a way that we can work with, the idea is to go row by row from the top to the bottom and for each entry, compute the maximum subtotal of paths that start at the top and end at that entry. To compute that maximum, we only need to add that entry's value to the maximum of the two maxima subpath's values in the entries above it (if it's not on the edge, the edge entries only have one path going through them). Once we've reached the bottom, we can look at which one is the maximum."
