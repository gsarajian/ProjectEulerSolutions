    "Denote $f(k)$ as the function described above, i.e. $f(k)$ is the smallest number $n$ for which $n$ can be factored as a product of $k$ numbers, and the sum of those $k$ numbers is $n$. Given some $k$, to compute $f(k)$, we generate a list of candidates $n$ and choose the minimum.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that $f(k) \\leq 2k$, since $n = 2k$ can be written as a product and sum of $k-2$ ones, a $2$, and $k$. Given this observation, we only generate candidates $n$ up to $24000$. For $n \\leq 24000$, we generate a list of all the factorizations of $n$ of that don't have $1$s as a factor. Then, for each of those factorizations, we compare the sum of the factors $s$, the number of factors in the factorization $l$, and $n$ itself. By padding the factorization with $1$s, we see that $n$ is a candidate for $n-s+l$. Once we've generated all the candadates, we loop thruogh the $k$ and take the minimum one to be $f(k)$, and after removing duplicates, we take the sum over all $2 \\leq k \\leq 12000$.\n",
