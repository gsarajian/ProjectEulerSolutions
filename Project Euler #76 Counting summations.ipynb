    "We start by considering a function $f(n)$ that counts how many ways to write $n$ as a sum of positive integers, where the trivial sum $n$ by itself counts. So $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 2$, $f(5) = 7$, and so on. We're looking for $f(100)-1$. To compute $f(n)$, we create a matrix whose $(i+1,j+1)$th entry is the number of ways we can write $i$ as a sum of positive numbers, the largest of which is $j$. This allows us to recursively compute the $(i+1, j+1)$st entry by taking the sum of the first $j$ elements of the $(i-j)$th row."
