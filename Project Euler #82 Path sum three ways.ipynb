    "We solve using the [Viterbi algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm). We convert the txt document into a matrix whose entries are the numbers in the file and keep track of the minimum sum of a path going through an entry. We compute this row by column, starting off by initializing the first column, then computing the proceeding column by starting at the top, computing all of the minima achieved by going down, and then comparing them to minima achieved by going up. Once we've done this for the whole matrix, we look at the smallest sums in the last column."
